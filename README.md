# Elevator Simulation (C++17)

Console-based elevator simulation that models multiple elevators servicing requests across floors, with request assignment and step-by-step simulation output.

## Build
```bash
make

## Run

make run

## Notes
- Written in C++17
- Uses a simple simulation “tick” loop to advance elevator state
